This project used the Create React App as the basis for initialization.

It consists of a React front end using Client-Side Routing to display flights and bookings to communicate with a back end JSON api server running on Sinatra. 

We use react-router-dom 5.2.0 to tie in with the lessons provided by Flatiron School.

Backend api is located here: https://github.com/someguy528/phase-3-sinatra-react-project
